## Problem Statement

Access to timely healthcare is often delayed due to inefficient discovery,
manual triage, and uneven distribution of healthcare providers.
This project aims to build a backend-centric healthcare access system
that intelligently matches patients with suitable healthcare resources
based on urgency, location, availability, and historical effectiveness.
The system prioritizes scalability, observability, and automation over UI complexity.
